= Microservices & Event Sourcing, Clean Architecture, DDD, SAGA, Outbox & Kafka & Apache Camel

* Why Apache Camel?... Apache Camel brings EIP patterns and tries to remove a lot of code bloats and unnecessary tons of layers, sometimes, imposed by Clear Architecture and Hexagonal Concepts

* The main structure removes the submodules idea, why?
To get rid of hell submodules management, here I try to keep the hexagonal concepts, but over the EIP and Camel perspectives; that means, the verbosity of frameworks will be reduced the main idea behind of Apache Camel is to eliminate tons of layers

== List Content

. Microservicesâ€”powered by Quarkus and Apache Camel
. Clean & Hexagonal Architecture
. Domain Driven Design (DDD): Bounded context, Entities, Aggregates, Value Objects, Domain services, Application services, and Domain Events
. Kafka: Event store for eds (Event-driven Services), enable loosely coupled services that communicate through events

== Hexagonal Architecture

. Classified as Ports & Adapters
. Divides the software as insides and outsides, starting inside by domain layer
. The principle of Hexagonal is isolate the domain layer from any dependency such UI, Data layer infrastructure or any framework

== DDD Introduction

. Domain Drive Design offers solutions to common problem when building enterprise
. We can classify DDD as Strategic or Tactical
.. Strategic DDD: Introduces boundaries for domain model, domain is an operational area of your application, e.g; Online food ordering
... Bounded Context: Central pattern in DDD, Boundary within a Domain
... Ubiquitous Language: Common Language used by domain Experts and devs to avoid technical terms

.Food Ordering Application classified (Domain)
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/ddd-strategic.png[]

. Tactical DDD: Focuses on the implementation details of the domain logic such as:
.. Entities: Domain object with a Unique Identifier, embodies critical business rules
.. Aggregates: Group of Entities that needs a consistent state

.Tactical Strategic Exercise Applied p2
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/tactica_ddd_entities.png[]

.Tactical DDD Aggregate Root Concepts
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/aggregate-root.png[]

.Order Aggregates
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/order-aggragates-sample.png[]

.Order Service Clean Architecture
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/order-service-clean-architecture.png[]

.Mapped Dependencies
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/mapped_dependencies.png[]

... Aggregate Root (AR): Entrypoint Entity for an aggregate, all business operations should go through root, as rule an aggregate should be referenced from outside through its root only, AR must be pure, side-effect free

.Aggregate Root Classification
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/order-aggragates-sample.png[]

... Value Objects: Immutable Objects without identity

.Value Objects
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/value-object.png[]

... Domain Events: describe things that happens and changes over the state of a domain

.Domain Events
image::architecture/thumbs/images/concepts/event-source-kafka.png[]

... Domain Services: Business logic that cannot fit in the aggregate, is used when multiple aggregates required in business logic

... Applications Services: allows the isolated domain to communicate with outside, such - orchestrate transactions, security, looking up proper aggregates and saving state changes of the domain to the database, doesn't contain any business logic, they are triggered by domain events, they should not know about how to fire event

... #_Where to fire the Event?
In Application Service, domain layers shouldn't know about how to fire the event_#

== Kafka Architecture

. Kafka brokers: Servers run in a cluster
. Topics: Logical data unit that holds multiple partition
. Partitions: Smallest storage unit that holds subset of records
. Producers: Writers to end of a specific partition
. Consumers: Reads from a partition using a offset

.Kafka Topics Configuration
****
payment-request partitions 3

payment-response partitions 3

restaurant-approval-request partitions 3

restaurant-approval-response partitions 3
